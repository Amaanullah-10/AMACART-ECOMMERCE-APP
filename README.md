This is a Full Stack Ecommerce web application made using React JS,Sanity DB and Stripe primarily so basically the front end is made using React JS and the backend
is maintained by using Sanity DB wherein most of our data is stored and yeah as you all know React helps us display those data by the cool features that it provides
and in addition to that we make use of Stripe in order to maintain our transaction, the current project is made for demo purposes so i do not use any real money. In
order to do that just add fake account so to know that checkout google it'll help you out with that. Clone and run project to avoid confusions and to have a clear
overview.

GET STARTED !!!


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
